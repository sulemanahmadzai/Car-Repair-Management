# Color Alignment Fix ‚úÖ

## Issue Identified

The icon colors in the **Features Section** were not displaying correctly because of dynamic Tailwind class names that don't work with JIT compilation.

## Problem

```tsx
// ‚ùå This doesn't work - Tailwind can't generate classes dynamically
<feature.icon className={`w-8 h-8 text-${feature.color.replace("bg-", "")}`} />
```

Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler needs to see complete class names at build time. Dynamic class construction like `text-${color}` doesn't work because Tailwind can't parse and generate these classes.

## Solution

Changed to use inline styles with explicit color values:

```tsx
// ‚úÖ This works - inline styles with explicit colors
<feature.icon
  className="w-8 h-8"
  style={{
    color:
      feature.color === "bg-primary"
        ? "hsl(var(--primary))"
        : feature.color === "bg-blue-500"
        ? "#3b82f6"
        : feature.color === "bg-green-500"
        ? "#22c55e"
        : feature.color === "bg-purple-500"
        ? "#a855f7"
        : feature.color === "bg-indigo-500"
        ? "#6366f1"
        : "#ec4899",
  }}
/>
```

## Colors Applied

### Features Section Icons:

- **Primary (Orange)**: `hsl(var(--primary))` - #FA896B
- **Blue**: `#3b82f6` - For "Fast & Reliable Service"
- **Green**: `#22c55e` - For "12-Month Warranty"
- **Purple**: `#a855f7` - For "Certified Technicians"
- **Indigo**: `#6366f1` - For "Advanced Equipment"
- **Pink**: `#ec4899` - For "Customer First"

### Services Section:

‚úÖ Already working correctly with Tailwind gradient classes:

- Uses `bg-gradient-to-br from-red-500 to-orange-500` etc.
- These work because they're complete class names, not dynamic

### Other Sections:

‚úÖ All other sections (Hero, About, Stats, Testimonials, Header, Footer) are working correctly with proper color alignment.

## Verification

Run your development server to see the colors now properly displayed:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

All icons should now display in their intended colors! üé®‚ú®
