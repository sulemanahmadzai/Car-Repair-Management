### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Responsive tables with horizontal scroll
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly button sizes

## Data Flow

### Creating Staff Member

1. User clicks "Add New Staff" button
2. Fills out the form with staff details
3. Client validates required fields (fullName, phoneNumber)
4. Sends POST request to `/api/staff`
5. API validates user authentication and team membership
6. Creates staff record in database
7. Redirects to staff list page
8. SWR automatically refreshes the list

### Editing Staff Member

1. User clicks Edit button on list or detail page
2. System fetches current staff data
3. Pre-populates form with existing values
4. User makes changes
5. Sends PUT request to `/api/staff` with staff ID
6. API validates and updates record
7. Redirects to detail page showing updated data

### Viewing Staff Details

1. User clicks View button on staff list
2. Fetches staff data via SWR
3. Displays comprehensive information in organized cards
4. Shows color-coded status badge
5. Provides quick access to Edit and Delete actions

### Deleting Staff Member

1. User clicks Delete button
2. Shows confirmation dialog
3. On confirmation, sends DELETE request
4. API removes record from database
5. Redirects to staff list or refreshes data

## Team-Based Security

All staff operations are scoped to the user's team:

- Users can only view staff from their own team
- Create, update, and delete operations verify team ownership
- Database queries include team_id filter
- No cross-team data access possible

## Validation

### Required Fields

- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Team ID (automatically set)

### Optional Fields

- All other fields are optional, allowing flexible data entry
- Validation happens on both client and server side
- Clear error messages for validation failures

## Search & Filter Capabilities

### Search

- Real-time client-side search
- Searches across multiple fields:
  - Full name
  - Email
  - Phone number
  - Role
  - Department
- Case-insensitive matching

### Filter

- Status filter dropdown
- Options: All, Active, Inactive, On Leave
- Combines with search for refined results

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript implementation
2. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling on client and server
3. **Loading States:** Skeleton loaders and button disabled states
4. **User Feedback:** Success/error messages and confirmations
5. **Data Validation:** Both client-side and server-side validation
6. **Security:** Team-based access control and authentication
7. **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach
8. **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
9. **Code Organization:** Consistent file structure and naming
10. **Reusability:** Shared components and utilities
