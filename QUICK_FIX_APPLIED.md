# ✅ Cache Bug Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The caching implementation had a **double JSON serialization bug**:

- Upstash Redis automatically serializes JSON
- But we were also manually calling `JSON.stringify()`
- Result: Data was stored as a string instead of an object
- This broke `.filter()`, `.charAt()`, and other methods

## What Was Fixed

✅ **lib/cache/helpers.ts** - Removed manual `JSON.stringify()` calls  
✅ **Cache cleared** - All corrupted data removed  
✅ **New utility** - Added `pnpm cache:clear` command  
✅ **Documentation** - Added troubleshooting guide

## What You Need to Do

### The cache has already been cleared! Just restart your dev server:

```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
pnpm dev
```

That's it! Everything should work now. ✅

## Verify It Works

1. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/customers
2. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/staff
3. Check console - should see proper cache logs:
   ```
   [Cache MISS] customers:1:1:10
   [Cache SET] customers:1:1:10 (TTL: 300s)
   [Cache HIT] customers:1:1:10  ← Data is now correctly cached!
   ```
4. No more TypeErrors! 🎉

## If Issues Persist

Clear cache again:

```bash
pnpm cache:clear
```

Or temporarily disable Redis by removing from `.env.local`:

```bash
# Comment out or remove these lines:
# UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=...
# UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
```

## New Commands Available

```bash
pnpm cache:clear    # Clear all Redis cache
```

**Status:** ✅ Bug fixed, cache cleared, ready to use!

The errors you saw were:

- ❌ `TypeError: data.filter is not a function` → ✅ FIXED
- ❌ `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')` → ✅ FIXED

Just restart your dev server and you're good to go! 🚀
