## Overview

Added WhatsApp notification functionality to automatically notify customers when a service is marked as completed. This feature provides a seamless way for admins to communicate with customers directly through WhatsApp.

## Implementation Date

December 2024

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Modal on Service Completion

When an admin marks a service record status as "completed":

- System automatically detects the status change
- If customer data is available (by vehicle registration), shows a modal
- Modal displays customer name and phone number
- Provides one-click access to WhatsApp

### 2. WhatsApp Integration

**File:** `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/service-records/edit/[id]/page.tsx`

**New Features:**

- `MessageCircle` icon import added
- `showWhatsAppModal` state management
- `handleWhatsAppClick` function to open WhatsApp
- Automatic modal trigger when status = "completed"
- Floating action button for quick access

### 3. User Flow

```
Admin marks service as "completed"
    ↓
Modal appears with customer details
    ↓
Admin clicks "Open WhatsApp" button
    ↓
WhatsApp opens with customer's number
    ↓
Admin can share service details, video, etc.
```

### 4. Components Added

#### WhatsApp Modal (`showWhatsAppModal`)

- Shows customer name and phone number
- Green checkmark icon for visual confirmation
- Two options: "Open WhatsApp" or "Maybe Later"
- Clean, user-friendly UI with Card component

#### Floating WhatsApp Button

- Appears when service is completed
- Bottom-right corner, always visible
- Fixed position (z-40) so it stays on screen
- Only shows when modal is closed
- Quick access for multiple communications

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### State Management

```typescript
const [showWhatsAppModal, setShowWhatsAppModal] = useState(false);
```

#### Status Detection

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (formData.status === "completed" && customerData && !showWhatsAppModal) {
    setShowWhatsAppModal(true);
  }
}, [formData.status, customerData]);
```

#### WhatsApp Handler

```typescript
const handleWhatsAppClick = (phone: string) => {
  const cleanPhone = phone.replace(/\D/g, "");
  window.open(`https://wa.me/${cleanPhone}`, "_blank");
  setShowWhatsAppModal(false);
};
```

### 6. WhatsApp Link Format

**Format:** `https://wa.me/{phone}`

**Benefits:**

- Works on mobile (opens WhatsApp app if installed)
- Works on desktop (opens WhatsApp Web)
- Phone number cleaned automatically (removes non-digits)
- Opens in new tab/window

**Example:**

- Customer phone: `+44 7123 456789`
